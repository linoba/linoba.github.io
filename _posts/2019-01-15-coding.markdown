I started recently to practice my coding skills on [topcoder][topcoder], handle [the12][topcoder-handle].
The site features various contests, e.g. short SRMs (single round matches) or longer MMs (marathon matches) like [StainedGlass][stained-glass-standings] for competitive programming.
Other challenges are available in the categories design, development and data science. Those challenges are partially cash-rewarded, like [IARPAs mercury challenge][mercury], but mostly offer a great platform to further develop coding skills.
